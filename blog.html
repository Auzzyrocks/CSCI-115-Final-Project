                    With a passion for all things making, Austin deigned and built his own custom desk to fit his recording equipment. 
                        
                    <br><br>
                    On the left and right at industry standard 19" rack rails for conviniently mounting the most frequently used recording equipment, and the center space is designed to fit the studios centerpiece - a Tascam DM 3200 Hydbrid Console. 

                    For a list of just some of the equipment available at Echo 7, visit our 'About' page.

            <p class="text_left">
        The desk was built out of 5/8" Medium Density Fiberboard (MDF) and has 24 U of rack space, divided into four sections. There is an upper level where speakers can sit, and a lower bevel provides space for an armrest and keyboard. Underneath the desk are vaious cable management and power acomodations.

                A coat of black paint ties together the finished product, which always provides a proffesional impression to clients.

                In the summer of 2019 Austin purchased his dream vehicle - a 1984 Volkswagen Vanagon Westfalia
                        
                    <br><br>
                    'Sunny' features a rebuilt 1.9L wasserboxer (waterboxer) engine, rear wheel drive, and a four speed manual transmission. 
                    <br><br>
                    Camping amenities include a 100W solar panel and 140 amp-hour battery, a propane powered fridge, on-board water tank and sink, and a two twin beds - allowing four people to sleep in comfort.

     Since purchasing Sunny, Austin has had to learn the ins and outs of maintaining a vintage vehicle. Some of the repairs completed over that time include replacing the transmission, all new coolant hoses, a new alternator, and completly removing the interior to provide a rust-proof coating and insulation.

                Austin began working on building a synthesizer based on a Teensy 3.2 microcontroler last year. 
                        
                    <br><br>
                    The case was designed in CAD and CNC'd out of 6mm plywood. The buttons used are MX style mechanical keyboard switches, and a custom 3D printed mount was designed to attach them to the synthesizers faceplate.

                   The Synth features two oscillators with independant frequency and amplitude controls, as well as several selectable waveforms. There are two LFO's that control oscillator frequency, and a low-pass filter, with a 3rd LFO controlling filter cutoff frequency. 
                   <br><br>
                    Future plans include adding MIDI I/O capability, a screen to display parameter information, and the ability to save and recall presets.
