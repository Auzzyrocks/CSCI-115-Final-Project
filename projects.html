             With a passion for all things making, Austin deigned and built his own custom desk to fit his recording equipment. 
                
            <br><br>
            On the left and right at industry standard 19" rack rails for conviniently mounting the most frequently used recording equipment, and the center space is designed to fit the studios centerpiece - a Tascam DM 3200 Hydbrid Console. 

            For a list of just some of the equipment available at Echo 7, visit our 'About' page.

     The desk was built out of 5/8" Medium Density Fiberboard (MDF) and has 24 U of rack space, divided into four sections. There is an upper level where speakers can sit, and a lower bevel provides space for an armrest and keyboard. Underneath the desk are vaious cable management and power acomodations.

            A coat of black paint ties together the finished product, which always provides a proffesional impression to clients.
