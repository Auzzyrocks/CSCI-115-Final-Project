        Working in Calgary's largest venues, Austin gained valuable experience working with artists such as Lynryd Skynyrd, Slayer, and Billy Idol. Festival's such as Chaos, Oxford Stomp / Roundup, and Chasing Summer were exciting and offer valuable insight into running large scale events. 

        When the global pandemic of 2020 began, Austin shifted his talents back towards Marking, Communications, and Audio Production. Constructing, and then working out of his home studio, Austin worked with local Calgary musicians and buisness. In April of 2021 Austin relocated to Nanaimo, BC to focus on recording and to pursue his latest passion - computer science.
